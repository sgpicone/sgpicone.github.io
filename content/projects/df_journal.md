summary: A command line microjournaling app inspired by Dwarf Fortress
---

GitHub's private for now.

I had the idea a while ago to make an app that would let you pick an emotion and make entries for events in your life that could be viewed similarly to the output of a dwarf's `Thoughts and Feelings` readout in Dwarf Fortress.

Still a work in progress because I had a bit of a manic episode and decided to try to give it a proper front-end, which naturally led to becoming burnt out on the project and abandoning it for a spell.

I'll get back to it. Eventually.

Probably won't give it "proper" front-end, though. Think I'll leave it as a CLI.
